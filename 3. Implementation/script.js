/*
Recipe:
1. create a class for a Node
	- Test that this class can link to the SVG element on the HTML
	- Test that the class provides functionality like changing the Node Value, Color, Position etc..

2. create a class for an EdgeUI
	- The EdgeUI class is responsible to draw a line between 2 nodes no matter where are there positions on the Canvas
	- Test that this class can link to the SVG element on the HTML
	- Test that the class provides functionality like changing the edge stroke size, color, etc...

3. Hardcode a small graph represented as an Adjacency List

---> Might want to abstract away the usage between the SVG Tags and the Node & EdgeUI Classes
